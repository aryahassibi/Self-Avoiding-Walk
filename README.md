# Self-Avoiding Walk

A self-avoiding walk is a path from one point to another that never intersects itself. Such paths are usually considered to occur on lattices, so that steps are only allowed in a discrete number of directions and of certain lengths.

I have commented each file as best as I can, so If you want to know more about how each version of my self-avoiding walk works check the python files and read the comments. Now I'm gonna briefly explain the main differences between the versions here.

All of the spots on the path are stored in ***path***. The direction that a spot takes is stored in the corresponding index of ***directions***. The available options for a post on the path are stored in the corresponding index of ***options***. The program chooses a valid spot randomly to start the path. Then It chooses an available direction randomly and continues until it is stuck. If it is stuck it steps back until it reaches a spot where it can try another direction. The program continues the process until it finds a path that fills the grid.

I used the same algorithm as the first version to find a path.

Instead of going to new spots normally to create a path I used a recursive function to do it.

## Choosing the first spot randomly
The program chooses the first spot randomly, but then I found out that sometimes it is impossible to create a self-avoiding path. If the number of rows and columns of the grid are odd numbers, and one of the x-coordinate or y-coordinate of the first point is an even number and the other one is an odd number, then it is impossible to create a self-avoiding path. 



Now to prove this draw a grid with an odd number of rows and columns, let's say a 3 x 3 grid. Then color cells or spot that one of the x-coordinate or y-coordinate of them is an even number and the other one is an odd number, like (1, 2) or (3, 2). If you do this then you should be seeing a 3x3 grid with a check pattern, like this | ![3 by 3 grid with check pattern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31355913/128355641-1c06e2cf-c191-48ab-bb67-a03f70590a6f.png)

**In other words you can number the cells/spots like this, and color the even cells (in this case 2, 4, 6, 8)**| ![3 by 3 grid with check pattern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31355913/128355648-67f01410-61bd-4a2d-beb0-37fde44d56e3.png)

1. The length of a path is equal to the number of rows time the number of columns minus 1 (row x cols - 1), so for a 3 by 3 grid the length of a self-avoiding path would be 8. You can also conclude that *the length of the s-a path will be even for a grid with an odd number of rows and cols.*
2. Every step you take on the grid, you either step on an even/black cell from an odd/white cell or vise versa. Therefore your second step will be on a cell with the same color as the cell you started.

Based on these statements (1, 2) in an odd by odd grid if you start on a white cell you will end up on a white cell after getting to the end of your self-avoiding walk and you should end up on a black cell if you start on a black cell, but there is a problem. in an odd by odd grid, the number of black/even cells is always one less than the number of white/odd cells.** Ss stated before the length of the path is n x m - 1, so if you start on a black cell and finish on a black cell it means that you have stepped on ((n x m - 1) / 2) + 1 = (n x m + 1) / 2 = (3 x 3 + 1) / 2 = 5 black cells but there are only (n x m - 1) / 2 = (3 x 3 - 1) / 2 = 4 black cells. So, it is impossible to start on a black cell and finish on a black cell. Therefore, it is impossible to create a self-avoiding path that starts on a black cell(in an (odd x odd) grid).

For a  (n x m)  gird (which n and m are odd numbers) </br>
the number of black cells is equal to (n x m - 1) / 2 </br>
the number of white cells is equal to (n x m + 1) / 2
